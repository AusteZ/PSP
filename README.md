# Prerequisites

 - .NET 7.0 (didn't try with .NET 8 but probably won't work)

# How to run

 1. Clone repo
 2. If not using Visual studio: "dotnet run" in terminal, root project directory
 3. If using Visual Studio: File -> Open Solution/Folder -> Navigate to cloned repo -> open PSP.sln
 4. If using Visual Studio: Press the green little arrow in the top middle of the screen.
 5. Open 'http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html' in your browser to use the Swagger interface.

# Troubleshooting
Since I didn't test these instructions xd they might not work
possible issues:

 - Maybe "dotnet restore" in root directory is needed to install necessary packages/dependencies
 - If project doesn't launch. maybe you might need to install some more stuff, maybe something ASP.NET specific
